        amazing and actual useful marketing efforts that correctly represents the

        I just need some objective opinions to kick me out of this funk before the
        weekend ends and I have to give them my decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer&lt;/strong&gt;:

        of vacation after my first year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;401k

        I graduated with my Masters of Science in Computer Science in May &amp;#39;14.
        I also have a BSc in Mathematics and another in CS. After graduation, some
        plans to move out-of-country fell apart, and I fell into a position working
        as a programming consultant doing very basic stuff. For the past 4 months,
        I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a permanent position as a Software Engineer/Developer.

        area to live in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really need a permanent

        would get me out of my current job working with HTML/VB/IBM i control language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salary
        is low and company is known for underpaying and overworking employees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flat

        on the West coast (where I want to go). Should I expect a higher starting
        salary with my current background? My thesis work would have taken too long
        to finish (still working on it), so I don&amp;#39;t have any large papers
        or projects that I can point to.  Any advice? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank

        up in my home lab. The company also pays for SkillPort to encourage us to
        continue our certification path of choice, and I get to see a lot of different
        systems just during the day-to-day operations, which helps keep me from getting

        some time right after high school being really dumb, I got a later start to

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface - I&amp;#39;ve been
        a PC gamer since I was 11 or 12, I&amp;#39;m 38 now. My brother installed
        Spear of Destiny on my Dad&amp;#39;s work IBM, and that was it. Hooked, My
        mother called it &amp;quot;torturing sheep&amp;quot; because of the sounds
        the AI dying. I never got into modding or hosting. PC gaming lost it&amp;#39;s
        luster for me for a while, as there were no titles that I felt were really
        MADE for PC that I was into. WOW was enticing but I have Geek Shame, and generally
        don&amp;#39;t like Fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By my early 30&amp;#39;s
        I had essentially stopped PC gaming. I had a gaming PC, a HTPC, and still
        bought titles that would shine on the PC on the PC instead of PS3 or Xbox
        (yes I walk among the peasants. I&amp;#39;m not an elitist, I buy consoles
        just to check out exclusive titles to be more informed and to check out anything
        I find interesting. I also have 2 kids, so it&amp;#39;s easy to write that
        expense off on them for Xmas/Birthdays :-) ). When my son turned 10 or 11,
        I actually gave him my gaming PC so he could ascend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gaming
        for me, had reached a point, where I&amp;#39;d rather plop down on the couch,
        pop in a console title, and just play for 20-30min, when I got a chance (very
        busy single working parent of 2, with a job that requires work from home and
        on call 24/7).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it happened. What I consider to
        be the most important creations in gaming history. DayZ Mod.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As
        a long time gamer, and someone who had installed SOME mods a Long LOONG time
        ago, the idea of a Total Conversion Mod, was a bit out of scope for me...
        I barely even understood what I was hearing about, or looking at when I watched
        videos on youtube... The first time I saw it, I knew I had to get it. It sparked
        a fire inside me I don&amp;#39;t think I can possibly explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        slapped together a gaming PC out of the HTPC I already had, and so began my
        decent down the rabbit hole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I loved
        the game, started making a derivative mod, found out about author&amp;#39;s
        rights, and server hosting, and.... THE SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF GAMING:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets
        define the main players involved in the most basic terms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game
        Company - They create the base game, if there is MP, they decide whether or
        not individuals are allowed to mod for their game, and whether people can
        host servers for their game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distribution
        Networks/Publishers - Game Companies need to get the Game off their PC&amp;#39;s
        and onto yours, so they deal with Media Publishing companies to print/package
        DVD&amp;#39;s, or distribution programs that can be proprietary (Uplay) or
        cross platform (Steam)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modders -
        They create the altered content in mods, be-it new models, new functionality,
        or just new textures or sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server
        Hosts - Individuals or Companies (GSP&amp;#39;s or &amp;quot;Game Server Providers&amp;quot;)
        that have a server that is accessible to the public to play MP games on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players
        - That&amp;#39;s really all/most of us, but for this conversation, it&amp;#39;s
        consumer class gamers, people who have no involvement in the hosting, or creating
        of addons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have experience
        in every category besides 1 &amp;amp; 2. However, I know that Publishing Co&amp;#39;s
        can take as much as 10,20,30, even 40 percent of the margin on Retail games...
        and I BELIEVE steam is in the area of 33percent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So,
        lets start at the top and work down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The Game
        company, they invest hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions, in
        thousands of man hours, licensing of systems, for what equates to ENORMOUS
        RISK for a decent POTENTIAL for profit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Media
        Production companies have more known costs, and essentially have no risk.
        Distribution Networks like Steam and Uplay have backend costs that are more
        subject to fluctuation, and unknowns, however again, have minimal risk in
        the addition of one more game to their network. They have a HUGE potential
        for profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Modders MAY have some exposure in
        terms of their IP rights. For example, if a modder for Arma, happens to sell
        his models (created in commercially licensed 3d software) externally to 3rd
        parties for use other than the game, his release license for the game files
        cover him, but there is a risk of piracy of his models. But for a true hobby
        modder, there is NO risk, however, no matter how good or complete, or valuable
        your mods are, most modding terms of service (or the tools needed tos) expressly
        forbid working for profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Server Hosts CHA CHING
        BITCHES!!!! All the above people either have exposed themselves to risk, or
        invested large amounts of time and money. Running a game server community
        is NOT free, it is NOT cheap, and it DOES NOT happen on it&amp;#39;s own,
        but they are VERY WELL KNOWN costs and time requirements, and the potential
        for profit is GODDAM ENORMOUS. It&amp;#39;s not easy, by any stretch of the
        imagination, and it takes a lot of work, but the returns are potentially huge
        for what equates to exploiting a TON of other people&amp;#39;s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022
        Players pay for the game, and reap all the benefits of all the above. BUT,
        w/o you, literally NONE OF THE ABOVE would be doing anything but sitting in
        their mom&amp;#39;s basement coding their dreams for themselves... Exposure,
        and people enjoying the fruits of our labor is what 90 percent of the above
        people want. YES there are dirtbag predatory people, companies, and franchises
        in this industry, BUT, it&amp;#39;s largely populated with REALLY REALLY HAPPY
        people who can&amp;#39;t believe they get to do what they love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
        current problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Server hosts/ISPs/Gaming Communites
        get SHIT TONS of donations from you players... They in turn help sell a LOT
        of games for the Game Developers, The Distribution Networks get more volume
        of sales, and traffic... The modders, sit in their basements coding their
        dreams for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it may not be the case
        in ALL modding scenes, in Arma, you ARE NOT allowed to profit from your work
        in the series. PERIOD. While some break these rules, and do not face punishment
        or retribution, it forces anyone looking to eek out a break even scenario
        to break the terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Donations&amp;quot;
        that server hosts collect DO NOT trickle down to the modders who made most
        of the content they use, it goes to whoever agreed to help the server host
        exploit that content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the height of DayZ Mod
        popularity, the original Author of DayZ was likely making ZERO dollars, as
        dozens upon dozens of ISP&amp;#39;s and Server hosts, and Derivative mod makers
        were making THOUSANDS of dollars a week or month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT
        my friends is what&amp;#39;s wrong with the system. THAT is why Steam has
        begun steps to allow BOTH parties to profit. Server hosts DO DESERVE Donations,
        and if you&amp;#39;re willing to pay for reserved slots, or Donation Perks,
        then that&amp;#39;s fine, but not when it&amp;#39;s on a Terrain that someone
        else made in their spare time and has never seen a dime for. Or if you&amp;#39;re
        carrying a gun that someone spent dozens of hours modelling or configuring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        personally don&amp;#39;t plan to EVER charge for any mods I work on, but that
        doesn&amp;#39;t mean that other&amp;#39;s shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to. If
        you don&amp;#39;t like those mods, then don&amp;#39;t purchase them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO,
        the system needs slight tweaking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
        Mod Author should be able to be able to host the files elsewhere FOR FREE
        ONLY. In Arma, for example, manual download, or even using one of the launchers
        is STILL very complicated, a Steam subscribed mod is ENDLESSLY easier to deal
        with for the end user and offers a genuine value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
        should be no minimum price. If a mod author wants to charge .01 for his mod,
        it should be allowed, gaming is often a numbers game. Writing 3-10 scripts
        or making a ton of textures can add up to real money if they&amp;#39;re used
        by a lot of players across a lot of other missions/mods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server
        hosts hosting paid addons should have their donations be transparent, OR there
        should be a breakdown of WHERE to donate for the players... IE if a Server
        hosts hosts 3 addons, the donation button should allow to choose to split,
        or donate all your money to any or all of those 4 parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s
        all the system needs for it to work, and for YOU the players to get a MUCH
        MUCH more real means of offering feedback to server hosts, addon authors,
        game companies AND steam.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext":

        that other''s shouldn''t be able to. If you don''t like those mods, then don''t
        purchase them.\n\nIMO, the system needs slight tweaking. \n\n1. The Mod Author
        should be able to be able to host the files elsewhere FOR FREE ONLY. In Arma,
        for example, manual download, or even using one of the launchers is STILL
        very complicated, a Steam subscribed mod is ENDLESSLY easier to deal with
        for the end user and offers a genuine value.\n\n2. There should be no minimum
        price. If a mod author wants to charge .01 for his mod, it should be allowed,
        gaming is often a numbers game. Writing 3-10 scripts or making a ton of textures
        can add up to real money if they''re used by a lot of players across a lot
        of other missions/mods.\n\n3. Server hosts hosting paid addons should have
        their donations be transparent, OR there should be a breakdown of WHERE to
        donate for the players... IE if a Server hosts hosts 3 addons, the donation
        button should allow to choose to split, or donate all your money to any or
        all of those 4 parties.\n\nThat''s all the system needs for it to work, and
        for YOU the players to get a MUCH MUCH more real means of offering feedback
        to server hosts, addon authors, game companies AND steam.", "likes": null,

        providing some feedback from the perspective of a data scientist, which I

        class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit -- thanks for your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        am struggling with this decision and can&amp;#39;t seem to make a final decision.
        I just need some objective opinions to kick me out of this funk before the
        weekend ends and I have to give them my decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer&lt;/strong&gt;:
        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$53k/year (biweekly)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;decent
        health/dental (~$200/month)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~10 days
        of vacation after my first year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;401k
        with 50% match up to 6% of yearly income&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;:
        I graduated with my Masters of Science in Computer Science in May &amp;#39;14.
        I also have a BSc in Mathematics and another in CS. After graduation, some
        plans to move out-of-country fell apart, and I fell into a position working
        as a programming consultant doing very basic stuff. For the past 4 months,
        I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a permanent position as a Software Engineer/Developer.
        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
        like the company and what they&amp;#39;re working on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decent
        area to live in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really need a permanent
        job... and this is an offer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly
        workplace with the opportunity to learn a ton and work on interesting projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
        would get me out of my current job working with HTML/VB/IBM i control language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salary
        is low and company is known for underpaying and overworking employees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flat
        structure for developers -- no room for promotion, just more responsibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already
        told that I would be expected to work &amp;gt;50 hours/week with &amp;gt;60
        towards the end of a project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve
        only had one callback/interview after four months and I&amp;#39;m nervous
        that I&amp;#39;m jumping on the first offer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
        can&amp;#39;t afford to take my family&amp;#39;s dogs -- my disabled mom and
        overworked dad would have to deal with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically
        I feel like I haven&amp;#39;t looked hard enough or applied to enough places

        "Hi reddit -- thanks for your time!\n\nI am struggling with this decision
        and can''t seem to make a final decision. I just need some objective opinions
        to kick me out of this funk before the weekend ends and I have to give them
        my decision.\n\n**Offer**: \n\n* $53k/year (biweekly)\n\n* decent health/dental
        (~$200/month)\n\n* ~10 days of vacation after my first year\n\n* 401k with
        50% match up to 6% of yearly income\n\n\n\n**Background**: I graduated with
        my Masters of Science in Computer Science in May ''14. I also have a BSc in
        Mathematics and another in CS. After graduation, some plans to move out-of-country
        fell apart, and I fell into a position working as a programming consultant
        doing very basic stuff. For the past 4 months, I''ve been looking for a permanent
        position as a Software Engineer/Developer. \n\n\n\n**Pros**: \n\n* I like
        the company and what they''re working on\n\n* Decent area to live in\n\n*
        I really need a permanent job... and this is an offer\n\n* Friendly workplace
        with the opportunity to learn a ton and work on interesting projects\n\n*
        It would get me out of my current job working with HTML/VB/IBM i control language\n\n\n\n**Cons**:\n\n*
        Salary is low and company is known for underpaying and overworking employees\n\n*
        Flat structure for developers -- no room for promotion, just more responsibility\n\n*
        Already told that I would be expected to work &gt;50 hours/week with &gt;60
        towards the end of a project\n\n* I''ve only had one callback/interview after
        four months and I''m nervous that I''m jumping on the first offer\n\n* I can''t
        afford to take my family''s dogs -- my disabled mom and overworked dad would
        have to deal with it\n\n\n\nBasically I feel like I haven''t looked hard enough
        or applied to enough places on the West coast (where I want to go). Should
        I expect a higher starting salary with my current background? My thesis work
        would have taken too long to finish (still working on it), so I don''t have
        any large papers or projects that I can point to.  Any advice? \n\n\n\nThank

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface - I&amp;#39;ve been
        a PC gamer since I was 11 or 12, I&amp;#39;m 38 now. My brother installed
        Spear of Destiny on my Dad&amp;#39;s work IBM, and that was it. Hooked, My
        mother called it &amp;quot;torturing sheep&amp;quot; because of the sounds
        the AI dying. I never got into modding or hosting. PC gaming lost it&amp;#39;s
        luster for me for a while, as there were no titles that I felt were really
        MADE for PC that I was into. WOW was enticing but I have Geek Shame, and generally
        don&amp;#39;t like Fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By my early 30&amp;#39;s
        I had essentially stopped PC gaming. I had a gaming PC, a HTPC, and still
        bought titles that would shine on the PC on the PC instead of PS3 or Xbox
        (yes I walk among the peasants. I&amp;#39;m not an elitist, I buy consoles
        just to check out exclusive titles to be more informed and to check out anything
        I find interesting. I also have 2 kids, so it&amp;#39;s easy to write that
        expense off on them for Xmas/Birthdays :-) ). When my son turned 10 or 11,
        I actually gave him my gaming PC so he could ascend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gaming
        for me, had reached a point, where I&amp;#39;d rather plop down on the couch,
        pop in a console title, and just play for 20-30min, when I got a chance (very
        busy single working parent of 2, with a job that requires work from home and
        on call 24/7).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it happened. What I consider to
        be the most important creations in gaming history. DayZ Mod.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As
        a long time gamer, and someone who had installed SOME mods a Long LOONG time
        ago, the idea of a Total Conversion Mod, was a bit out of scope for me...
        I barely even understood what I was hearing about, or looking at when I watched
        videos on youtube... The first time I saw it, I knew I had to get it. It sparked
        a fire inside me I don&amp;#39;t think I can possibly explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        slapped together a gaming PC out of the HTPC I already had, and so began my
        decent down the rabbit hole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I loved
        the game, started making a derivative mod, found out about author&amp;#39;s
        rights, and server hosting, and.... THE SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF GAMING:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets
        define the main players involved in the most basic terms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game
        Company - They create the base game, if there is MP, they decide whether or
        not individuals are allowed to mod for their game, and whether people can
        host servers for their game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distribution
        Networks/Publishers - Game Companies need to get the Game off their PC&amp;#39;s
        and onto yours, so they deal with Media Publishing companies to print/package
        DVD&amp;#39;s, or distribution programs that can be proprietary (Uplay) or
        cross platform (Steam)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modders -
        They create the altered content in mods, be-it new models, new functionality,
        or just new textures or sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server
        Hosts - Individuals or Companies (GSP&amp;#39;s or &amp;quot;Game Server Providers&amp;quot;)
        that have a server that is accessible to the public to play MP games on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players
        - That&amp;#39;s really all/most of us, but for this conversation, it&amp;#39;s
        consumer class gamers, people who have no involvement in the hosting, or creating
        of addons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have experience
        in every category besides 1 &amp;amp; 2. However, I know that Publishing Co&amp;#39;s
        can take as much as 10,20,30, even 40 percent of the margin on Retail games...
        and I BELIEVE steam is in the area of 33percent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So,
        lets start at the top and work down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The Game
        company, they invest hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions, in
        thousands of man hours, licensing of systems, for what equates to ENORMOUS
        RISK for a decent POTENTIAL for profit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Media
        Production companies have more known costs, and essentially have no risk.
        Distribution Networks like Steam and Uplay have backend costs that are more
        subject to fluctuation, and unknowns, however again, have minimal risk in
        the addition of one more game to their network. They have a HUGE potential
        for profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Modders MAY have some exposure in
        terms of their IP rights. For example, if a modder for Arma, happens to sell
        his models (created in commercially licensed 3d software) externally to 3rd
        parties for use other than the game, his release license for the game files
        cover him, but there is a risk of piracy of his models. But for a true hobby
        modder, there is NO risk, however, no matter how good or complete, or valuable
        your mods are, most modding terms of service (or the tools needed tos) expressly
        forbid working for profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Server Hosts CHA CHING
        BITCHES!!!! All the above people either have exposed themselves to risk, or
        invested large amounts of time and money. Running a game server community
        is NOT free, it is NOT cheap, and it DOES NOT happen on it&amp;#39;s own,
        but they are VERY WELL KNOWN costs and time requirements, and the potential
        for profit is GODDAM ENORMOUS. It&amp;#39;s not easy, by any stretch of the
        imagination, and it takes a lot of work, but the returns are potentially huge
        for what equates to exploiting a TON of other people&amp;#39;s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022
        Players pay for the game, and reap all the benefits of all the above. BUT,
        w/o you, literally NONE OF THE ABOVE would be doing anything but sitting in
        their mom&amp;#39;s basement coding their dreams for themselves... Exposure,
        and people enjoying the fruits of our labor is what 90 percent of the above
        people want. YES there are dirtbag predatory people, companies, and franchises
        in this industry, BUT, it&amp;#39;s largely populated with REALLY REALLY HAPPY
        people who can&amp;#39;t believe they get to do what they love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
        current problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Server hosts/ISPs/Gaming Communites
        get SHIT TONS of donations from you players... They in turn help sell a LOT
        of games for the Game Developers, The Distribution Networks get more volume
        of sales, and traffic... The modders, sit in their basements coding their
        dreams for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it may not be the case
        in ALL modding scenes, in Arma, you ARE NOT allowed to profit from your work
        in the series. PERIOD. While some break these rules, and do not face punishment
        or retribution, it forces anyone looking to eek out a break even scenario
        to break the terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Donations&amp;quot;
        that server hosts collect DO NOT trickle down to the modders who made most
        of the content they use, it goes to whoever agreed to help the server host
        exploit that content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the height of DayZ Mod
        popularity, the original Author of DayZ was likely making ZERO dollars, as
        dozens upon dozens of ISP&amp;#39;s and Server hosts, and Derivative mod makers
        were making THOUSANDS of dollars a week or month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT
        my friends is what&amp;#39;s wrong with the system. THAT is why Steam has
        begun steps to allow BOTH parties to profit. Server hosts DO DESERVE Donations,
        and if you&amp;#39;re willing to pay for reserved slots, or Donation Perks,
        then that&amp;#39;s fine, but not when it&amp;#39;s on a Terrain that someone
        else made in their spare time and has never seen a dime for. Or if you&amp;#39;re
        carrying a gun that someone spent dozens of hours modelling or configuring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        personally don&amp;#39;t plan to EVER charge for any mods I work on, but that
        doesn&amp;#39;t mean that other&amp;#39;s shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to. If
        you don&amp;#39;t like those mods, then don&amp;#39;t purchase them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO,
        the system needs slight tweaking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
        Mod Author should be able to be able to host the files elsewhere FOR FREE
        ONLY. In Arma, for example, manual download, or even using one of the launchers
        is STILL very complicated, a Steam subscribed mod is ENDLESSLY easier to deal
        with for the end user and offers a genuine value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
        should be no minimum price. If a mod author wants to charge .01 for his mod,
        it should be allowed, gaming is often a numbers game. Writing 3-10 scripts
        or making a ton of textures can add up to real money if they&amp;#39;re used
        by a lot of players across a lot of other missions/mods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server
        hosts hosting paid addons should have their donations be transparent, OR there
        should be a breakdown of WHERE to donate for the players... IE if a Server
        hosts hosts 3 addons, the donation button should allow to choose to split,
        or donate all your money to any or all of those 4 parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s
        all the system needs for it to work, and for YOU the players to get a MUCH
        MUCH more real means of offering feedback to server hosts, addon authors,
        game companies AND steam.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext":
        "Preface - I''ve been a PC gamer since I was 11 or 12, I''m 38 now. My brother
        installed Spear of Destiny on my Dad''s work IBM, and that was it. Hooked,
        My mother called it \"torturing sheep\" because of the sounds the AI dying.
        I never got into modding or hosting. PC gaming lost it''s luster for me for
        a while, as there were no titles that I felt were really MADE for PC that
        I was into. WOW was enticing but I have Geek Shame, and generally don''t like
        Fantasy.\n\nBy my early 30''s I had essentially stopped PC gaming. I had a
        gaming PC, a HTPC, and still bought titles that would shine on the PC on the
        PC instead of PS3 or Xbox (yes I walk among the peasants. I''m not an elitist,
        I buy consoles just to check out exclusive titles to be more informed and
        to check out anything I find interesting. I also have 2 kids, so it''s easy
        to write that expense off on them for Xmas/Birthdays :-) ). When my son turned
        10 or 11, I actually gave him my gaming PC so he could ascend. \n\nGaming
        for me, had reached a point, where I''d rather plop down on the couch, pop
        in a console title, and just play for 20-30min, when I got a chance (very
        busy single working parent of 2, with a job that requires work from home and
        on call 24/7).\n\nThen it happened. What I consider to be the most important
        creations in gaming history. DayZ Mod.\n\nAs a long time gamer, and someone
        who had installed SOME mods a Long LOONG time ago, the idea of a Total Conversion
        Mod, was a bit out of scope for me... I barely even understood what I was
        hearing about, or looking at when I watched videos on youtube... The first
        time I saw it, I knew I had to get it. It sparked a fire inside me I don''t
        think I can possibly explain.\n\nI slapped together a gaming PC out of the
        HTPC I already had, and so began my decent down the rabbit hole. \n\nLong
        story short, I loved the game, started making a derivative mod, found out
        about author''s rights, and server hosting, and.... THE SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF
        GAMING:\n\nLets define the main players involved in the most basic terms:\n\n1.
        Game Company - They create the base game, if there is MP, they decide whether
        or not individuals are allowed to mod for their game, and whether people can
        host servers for their game\n\n2. Distribution Networks/Publishers - Game
        Companies need to get the Game off their PC''s and onto yours, so they deal
        with Media Publishing companies to print/package DVD''s, or distribution programs
        that can be proprietary (Uplay) or cross platform (Steam)\n\n3. Modders -
        They create the altered content in mods, be-it new models, new functionality,
        or just new textures or sounds.\n\n4. Server Hosts - Individuals or Companies
        (GSP''s or \"Game Server Providers\") that have a server that is accessible
        to the public to play MP games on.\n\n5. Players - That''s really all/most
        of us, but for this conversation, it''s consumer class gamers, people who
        have no involvement in the hosting, or creating of addons.\n\nI have experience
        in every category besides 1 &amp; 2. However, I know that Publishing Co''s
        can take as much as 10,20,30, even 40 percent of the margin on Retail games...
        and I BELIEVE steam is in the area of 33percent. \n\nSo, lets start at the
        top and work down\n\n\u2022 The Game company, they invest hundreds of thousands
        of dollars if not millions, in thousands of man hours, licensing of systems,
        for what equates to ENORMOUS RISK for a decent POTENTIAL for profit. \n\n\u2022
        Media Production companies have more known costs, and essentially have no
        risk. Distribution Networks like Steam and Uplay have backend costs that are
        more subject to fluctuation, and unknowns, however again, have minimal risk
        in the addition of one more game to their network. They have a HUGE potential
        for profit.\n\n\u2022 Modders MAY have some exposure in terms of their IP
        rights. For example, if a modder for Arma, happens to sell his models (created
        in commercially licensed 3d software) externally to 3rd parties for use other
        than the game, his release license for the game files cover him, but there
        is a risk of piracy of his models. But for a true hobby modder, there is NO
        risk, however, no matter how good or complete, or valuable your mods are,
        most modding terms of service (or the tools needed tos) expressly forbid working
        for profit.\n\n\u2022 Server Hosts CHA CHING BITCHES!!!! All the above people

        it DOES NOT happen on it''s own, but they are VERY WELL KNOWN costs and time
        requirements, and the potential for profit is GODDAM ENORMOUS. It''s not easy,
        by any stretch of the imagination, and it takes a lot of work, but the returns
        are potentially huge for what equates to exploiting a TON of other people''s

        REALLY HAPPY people who can''t believe they get to do what they love.\n\nThe
        current problem.\n\nServer hosts/ISPs/Gaming Communites get SHIT TONS of donations

        The Distribution Networks get more volume of sales, and traffic... The modders,

        not be the case in ALL modding scenes, in Arma, you ARE NOT allowed to profit

        not face punishment or retribution, it forces anyone looking to eek out a
        break even scenario to break the terms of service.\n\nThe \"Donations\" that
        server hosts collect DO NOT trickle down to the modders who made most of the

        that content.\n\nDuring the height of DayZ Mod popularity, the original Author
